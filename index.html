          <p>
            Tarot (/ˈtæroʊ/, first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi or
            tarocks) is a set of playing cards used in tarot games and in
            fortune-telling or divination. From at least the mid-15th century,
            the tarot was used to play trick-taking card games such as
            Tarocchini. From their Italian roots, tarot games spread to most of
            Europe, evolving into new forms including German Grosstarok and
            modern examples such as French Tarot and Austrian Königrufen. Tarot
            is commonly found in many countries, especially in English and
            Spanish speaking countries where tarot games are not as widely
            played, in the form of specially designed cartomantic decks used
            primarily for tarot card reading, in which each card corresponds to
            an assigned archetype or interpretation for divination,
            fortune-telling or for other non-gaming uses. The emergence of
            custom decks for use in divination via tarot card reading and
            cartomancy began after French occultists made elaborate, but
            unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning in the late
            18th century.[1][2] Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot
            packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for
            divination. However, some older patterns, such as the Tarot de
            Marseille and the Swiss 1JJ Tarot, originally intended for playing
            card games, are also used for cartomancy.[3] Tarot has four suits
            that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and
            eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14
            cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten; and four
            face cards: King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page. In addition,
            the tarot also has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single card
            known as the Fool. Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the
            top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.[4] These tarot
            cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play trick-taking
            card games.

          <h2>Distribution</h2>
          <p>
            The use of tarot for trick-taking games was at one time widespread
            across the whole of Europe except the British Isles, the Iberian
            Peninsula, and the Balkans.[5] Having fallen into decline by the
            20th century, the games later experienced a renaissance in some
            countries and regions. For example, French Tarot was largely
            confined to Provence in the 18th century, but took off in the 1950s
            to such an extent that, in 1973, the French Tarot Association
            (Fédération Française de Tarot) was formed and French Tarot itself
            is now the second most popular card game in France.[6] Tarock games
            like Königrufen have experienced significant growth in Austria where
            international tournaments are held with other nations, especially
            those from eastern Europe that still play such games, including
            Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[7] Denmark appears to be
            the only Scandinavian country that still plays tarot games,[7]
            Danish Tarok being a derivative of historical German Grosstarock.
            The game of Cego has grown in popularity again in the south German
            region of Baden.[7] Italy continues to play regionally popular games
            with their distinctive Tarot packs. These include: Ottocento in
            Bologna and Sicilian Tarocchi in parts of Sicily.[7] Meanwhile
            Troccas and Troggu are still played locally in parts of
            Switzerland.[7]

          <h2>History</h2>
          <h3><strong>Playing cards and early tarot-like games</strong></h3>

          <p>
            Tarot cards, then known as tarocchi (Italian), first appeared in
            Ferrara and Milan in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 trumps
            (then called trionfi) being added to the standard Italian pack of
            four suits: batons, coins, cups and swords.[8] Scholarship has
            established that early European playing cards were probably based on
            the Egyptian Mamluk deck invented in or before the 14th century,
            which followed the introduction of paper from Asia into Western
            Europe.[9] By the late 1300s, Europeans were producing their own
            cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with
            variations to the suit symbols and court cards.[9] The first records
            of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in Bern and they appear to
            have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen
            from the records, mainly of card games being banned.[10][11][12]
            Little is known about the appearance and number of these cards, the
            only significant information being provided by a text by John of
            Rheinfelden in 1377 from Freiburg im Breisgau, who, in addition to
            other versions, describes the basic pack as containing the
            still-current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the
            King, Ober and Unter ("marshals"), although Dames and Queens were
            already known by then. An early pattern of playing cards used the
            suits of batons or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are
            still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing
            card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination
            cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.[13] A lost
            tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and
            described by Martiano da Tortona, probably between 1418 and 1425
            since the painter he mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to
            Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a
            60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the Roman gods and suits
            depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as
            "trumps" since, in 1449, Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the
            now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et exquisitum
            triumphorum genus, or "a new and exquisite kind of triumphs."[14]
            Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the
            Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.[4]

          <h3><strong>Early tarot decks</strong></h3>

          <!-- used strong to emphasize certain sections -->

          <p>
            The first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450
            in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna, when additional trump cards
            with allegorical illustrations were added to the common four-suit
            pack. These new decks were called carte da trionfi, triumph cards,
            and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became
            "trumps" in English. The earliest documentation of trionfi is found
            in a written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440,
            regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo
            Malatesta.[15][16] The oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so
            decks of the Visconti-Sforza Tarot painted in the mid-15th century
            for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan.[17] In 15th century Italy, the
            set of cards that was included in tarot packs, including trumps,
            seems to have been consistent, even if naming and ordering varied.
            There are two main exceptions:[18] Some late 15th-century decks like
            the Sola Busca tarot and the Boiardo deck had four suits, a fool,
            and 21 trumps, but none of the trump images match the images
            normally used on Italian tarot cards. They seem to have been made on
            the model of tarot decks, but were voluntary departures from an
            established standard. The Visconti di Mondrone pack, one of the
            Visconti-Sforza decks, originally had a Dame and a Maid in each
            suit, in addition to the standard King, Queen, Knight, and Jack.
            Additionally, the pack includes three trump cards which represent
            the theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are not
            present in any other tarot deck of that era. Although a Dominican
            preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in playing cards,
            chiefly because of their use in gambling, in a sermon in the 15th
            century,[19] no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its
            early history. Because the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted,
            the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It
            was only after the invention of the printing press that mass
            production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside
            of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the
            Italian Wars. The most prominent tarot deck version used in these
            two countries was the Tarot of Marseilles, of Milanese origin.[4]
            While the set of trumps was generally consistent, their order varied
            by region, perhaps as early as the 1440s. Michael Dummett placed
            them into three categories. In Bologna and Florence, the highest
            trump is the Angel, followed by the World. This group spread mainly
            southward through the Papal States, the Kingdom of Naples, and
            finally down to the Kingdom of Sicily but was also known in the
            Savoyard states. In Ferrara, the World was the highest, followed by
            Justice and the Angel. This group spread mainly to the northeast to
            Venice and Trento where it was only a passing fad. By the end of the
            16th century, this order became extinct. In Milan, the World was
            highest, followed by the Angel; this ordering is used in the Tarot
            of Marseilles. Dummett also wrote about a possible fourth lineage
            that may have existed along the Franco-Italian border. It spread
            north through France until its last descendant, the Belgian Tarot,
            went extinct around 1800.[20][21] In Florence, an expanded deck
            called Minchiate was later used. This deck of 97 cards includes
            astrological symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional
            tarot motifs.[4] The earliest known mention of this game, under the
            name of germini, dates to 1506.[22]

          <h2>Playing card decks</h2>

          <p>
            The original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very
            cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a
            manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of
            game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries
            until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French
            variant in 1637.[29] The game of tarot has many regional variations.
            Tarocchini has survived in Bologna and there are still others played
            in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less
            popular than elsewhere. The 18th century saw tarot's greatest
            revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games
            in Europe, played everywhere except Ireland and Britain, the Iberian
            peninsula, and the Ottoman Balkans.[30] French tarot experienced
            another revival, beginning in the 1970s, and France has the
            strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games—often known
            as tarock, tarok, or tarokk—are widely played in central Europe
            within the borders of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.

              <h3>Italian-suited decks</h3>

              Italian-suited decks were first devised in the 15th century in
              northern Italy. Three decks of this category are still used to
              play certain games: The Tarocco Piemontese consists of the four
              suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king,
              queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the pip cards for a total of
              78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is
              numbered 0 despite not being a trump. The Swiss 1JJ Tarot is
              similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno,
              and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical
              order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are
              not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese. The Tarocco Bolognese
              omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62
              cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are
              numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different
              graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the
              Tarot of Marseilles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Italo-Portuguese-suited deck</h3>

              The Tarocco Siciliano is the only deck to use the so-called
              Portuguese suit system, which uses Spanish pips but intersects
              them like Italian pips.[31] Some of the trumps are different such
              as the lowest trump, Miseria (destitution). It omits the Two and
              Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and
              cups: it thus has 64 cards, but the ace of coins is not used,
              being the bearer of the former stamp tax. The cards are quite
              small and not reversible.[9]
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Spanish-suited deck</h3>

              The sole surviving example of a Spanish-suited deck was produced
              around 1820 by Giacomo Recchi of Oneglia, Liguria and destined for
              Sardinia. The plain suit cards are copied from the Sardinian
              pattern designed just ten years earlier by José Martinez de Castro
              for Clemente Roxas in Madrid but with the addition of 10s and
              queens. The trumps are largely copied from an early version of the
              Tarocco Piemontese. At that time, Liguria, Sardinia, and Piedmont
              were all territories of the Savoyard state.[32][33][34]
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>French-suited deck</h3>

              French suited tarot cards use the suit signs of clubs, diamonds,
              hearts, and spades. With the exception of novelty decks,
              French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for card
              games. The earliest French-suited tarot decks were made by the de
              Poilly family of engravers, beginning with a Minchiate deck by
              François de Poilly in the late 1650s. Aside from these early
              outliers, the first generation of French-suited tarots depicted
              scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called "Tiertarock"
              (Tier being German for "animal") and first appeared around 1740.
              Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with
              genre art or veduta. The German states used to produce a variety
              of 78-card tarot packs using Italian suits, but later switching to
              French suited cards; some were imported to France. There remain
              only two French-suited patterns of Cego packs - the Cego Adler
              pack manufactured by ASS Altenburger and one with genre scenes by
              F.X. Schmid, which may reflect the mainstream German cards of the
              19th century. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these
              patterns: Industrie und Glück – the Industrie und Glück
              ("Diligence and Fortune"[a]) genre art tarock deck of Central
              Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54
              cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black
              suits are removed. There are 3 patterns – Types A, B and C – of
              which Type C has become the standard, whereas Types A and B appear
              in limited editions or specials. Tarot Nouveau – also called the
              Tarot Bourgeois – has a 78-card pack. It is commonly used for
              tarot games in France and for Danish Tarok in Denmark. It is also
              sometimes used in Germany to play Cego. Its genre art trumps use
              Arabic numerals in corner indices. Adler-Cego – this is an animal
              tarot that is used in the Upper Rhine valley and neighbouring
              mountain regions such as the Black Forest or the Vosges It has 54
              cards organized in the same fashion as the Industrie und Glück
              packs. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices.
              Schmid-Cego - this pack by F.X. Schmid is of the Bourgeois Tarot
              type and has genre scenes similar to those of the Tarot Nouveau,
              but the Arabic numerals are centred as in the Adler-Cego pack.

              <h3>German-suited tarock cards</h3>

              From the late 18th century, in addition to producing their own
              true Tarot packs, the south German states manufactured
              German-suited packs labeled "Taroc", "Tarock" or "Deutsch-Tarok".
              These survive as "Schafkopf/Tarock" packs of the Bavarian and
              Franconian pattern. These are not true tarot packs, but standard
              36-card German-suited decks for games like German Tarok,
              Bauerntarock, Württemberg Tarock and Bavarian Tarock. Until the
              1980s there were also Tarock packs in the Württemberg pattern.
              There are 36 cards; the pip cards ranging from 6 to 10, Under
              Knave (Unter), Over Knave (Ober), King, and Ace. These use ace–ten
              ranking, like klaverjas, where ace is the highest followed by 10,
              king, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default
              trump suit.[4] The Bavarian pack is also used to play Schafkopf by
              excluding the Sixes

          <h2>Cartomancy</h2>
          <p>
            In countries where tarot trick taking games are not widely played,
            such as English speaking countries, only specially designed
            cartomantic tarot cards, used primarily for novelty and divination,
            are readily available.[4] The early French occultists claimed that
            tarot cards had esoteric links to ancient Egypt, Kabbalah, the Indic
            Tantra, or I Ching, claims that have been frequently repeated by
            authors on card divination. However, scholarly research has
            demonstrated that tarot cards were invented in northern Italy in the
            mid-15th century and confirmed that there is no historical evidence
            of any significant use of tarot cards for divination until the late
            18th century.[4][35] The tarot's esoteric ties and obscured origins
            proposed in theories by freemasons and occultists during this period
            led to the implied authority of the deck and its users.[36]
            Historians such as Michael Dummett have described the Tarot pack as
            "the subject of the most successful propaganda campaign ever
            launched [...] An entire false history and false interpretation of
            the Tarot pack was concocted by the occultists and it is all but
            universally believed."[37][38] The earliest evidence of a tarot deck
            used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around
            1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards
            of the Tarocco Bolognese.[39][40] The popularization of esoteric
            tarot started with Antoine Court and Jean-Baptiste Alliette
            (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the Tarot of
            Marseilles.[41] French tarot players abandoned the Marseilles tarot
            in favor of the Tarot Nouveau around 1900, with the result that the
            Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers. Etteilla was
            the first to produce a bespoke tarot deck specifically designed for
            occult purposes around 1789. In keeping with the unsubstantiated
            belief that such cards were derived from the Book of Thoth,
            Etteilla's tarot contained themes related to ancient Egypt.[41] In
            the occult tradition, tarot cards are referred to as "arcana", with
            the Fool and 21 trumps being termed the Major Arcana and the suit
            cards the Minor Arcana,[42] terms not used by players of tarot card
            games. The 78-card tarot deck used by esotericists has two distinct
            parts: The Major Arcana (greater secrets) consists of 22 cards
            without suits. Their names and numbers vary, but in a typical
            scheme, the names are: The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess,
            The Empress, The Emperor, The Hierophant, The Lovers, The Chariot,
            Strength, The Hermit, Wheel of Fortune, Justice, The Hanged Man,
            Death, Temperance, The Devil, The Tower, The Star, The Moon, The
            Sun, Judgement, and The World. Cards from The Magician to The World
            are numbered in Roman numerals from I to XXI, while The Fool is the
            only unnumbered card, sometimes placed at the beginning of the deck
            as 0, or at the end as XXII. The Minor Arcana (lesser secrets)
            consists of 56 cards, divided into four suits of 14 cards each; Ten
            numbered cards and four court cards. The court cards are the King,
            Queen, Knight and Page/Jack, in each of the four tarot suits. The
            traditional Italian tarot suits are swords, batons, coins and cups;
            however, in modern occult tarot decks, the suit of batons is often
            called wands, rods or staves; the suit of coins is often called
            pentacles or disks and the suit of cups is often referred to as
            goblets. The terms "Major Arcana" and "Minor Arcana" were first used
            by Jean-Baptiste Pitois (also known as Paul Christian), but are
            never used in relation to tarot card games.[43] Some decks exist
            primarily as artwork, and such art decks sometimes contain only the
            22 Major Arcana. The three most common decks used in esoteric tarot
            are the Tarot of Marseilles (a playing card pack), the Rider–Waite
            Tarot, and the Thoth Tarot.[41] Aleister Crowley, who devised the
            Thoth deck along with Lady Frieda Harris, stated of the tarot: "The
            origin of this pack of cards is very obscure. Some authorities seek
            to put it back as far as the ancient Egyptian Mysteries; others try
            to bring it forward as late as the fifteenth or even the sixteenth
            century ... [but] The only theory of ultimate interest about the
            tarot is that it is an admirable symbolic picture of the Universe,
            based on the data of the Holy Qabalah."[44]
